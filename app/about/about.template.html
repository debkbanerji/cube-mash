    <h2>What is CubeMash?</h2>
    <p>
        CubeMash is a web app that allows
        you to compare twisty puzzles.
        Playing is fairly straightforward;
        you're presented with two puzzles
        and can either choose which one
        you prefer or skip
        to the next comparison.
        You can then view stats to see where
        puzzles rank in terms of popularity.

    <h3>So you're trying to see which puzzles are better than others...</h3>
    <p>
        The quality of a puzzle can be quite subjective.
        I don't believe in the concept of a single 'best' puzzle.
        CubeMash is simply a way to see which puzzles
        are more popular than others. You may not always like an extremely
        popular puzzle, because liking a puzzle
        often comes down to personal preference.

    <h3>Where did you get the data from?</h3>
    <p>
        I built the database using data from

    <h3>How did you choose the puzzle categories?</h3>
    <p>
        There is one category for each official WCA puzzle, except for clock.

<div class="container-fluid">
    <h3>Why no clock?</h3>
    <strike>
        Because there is basically only one good clock on the market.
    </strike>
    <p>Because clock.</p>

    <h3>What's up with the name?</h3>

    <p>
        It was the only name I could think of.
    </p>
    <strike>
        Besides, there are far worse names I could have chosen.
